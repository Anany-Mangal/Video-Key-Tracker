A simple interface I created to test an algorithm. The interface asks your name, after which you can upload a video of your choice. As the uploaded video plays, any key pressed during the playback gets recorded againt the current timestamp of the video. The recorded data can then be downloaded in csv, json or txt format as per need.
The collected data can be used to understand which part of the uploaded video users find more interesting compared to the other parts of the video. This can be used to figure out "boring" parts of the video and can therefore be utilized to create videos that are more engaging for the users.
This can seek potential uses in the education industry where the behavior of students can be monitored against a playing video, figuring which parts of the video they find uninteresting.
